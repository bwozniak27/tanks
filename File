Notes Document:

1. The movement is still super glitchy. The passive movement sequence goes: check_distance
    -> which_turn -> change_direction -> move.
2. Maybe I should try and mimick the wii tanks more and do the movement by rotating the
    body of the tank and just moving forward. I would have a function that just
    handles the math behind it.
3. Should I just have it stop every time I want to turn? Certainly it would be less glitchy
    but wouldn't look as cool.
